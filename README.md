# RYT App

A React Native application built with Expo, NativeWind, and Lucide icons.

## Features

- React Native with Expo
- NativeWind for styling (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- Lucide icons
- TypeScript support
- Dark/Light theme support

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Using NativeWind

Use the `className` prop to add styles to your components:

```tsx
<View className="flex-1 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 p-4">
  <Text className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-500">Hello World</Text>
</View>
```

## Using Lucide Icons

Import icons directly from the lucide-react-native package:

```tsx
import { Heart, Home, Settings } from "lucide-react-native";

// Use in your component
<Heart size={24} className="text-red-500" />;
```

## Notes

- The `className` prop works on both React Native components and Lucide icons
- NativeWind automatically handles dark mode when using `dark:` prefix in class names

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
